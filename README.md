# Vuetips

My friend @leonardoscorza has a blog called [OneBitCode](https://onebitcode.com) and he asked me to write a post about VueJS.
What I've written here is the basics for any developer to start learning about this great frontend framework.
Have a look at the [commits](https://github.com/tmmgarcia/vuetips/commits/master) and please let me know if you have any suggestions on my [twitter](twitter.com/tmmgarcia)
